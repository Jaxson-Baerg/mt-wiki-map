LHL Node Skeleton
=========

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
  - API_KEY: `YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE`
  (Google Maps API key requires a google cloud account)
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
5. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
6. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss` (Ensure `npm run sass-watch` is running).
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

## Dependencies

- Node 10.x or above
